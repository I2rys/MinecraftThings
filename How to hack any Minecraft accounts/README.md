## Methods to bypass servers login
Here are the important principles
+ Patients
+ Convincing
+ Acting

### Method 1
Make sure the Minecraft server has a forum/Discord where you can reset your password, talk to the staff & Use optifine so version the account skin will show.

This mostly works if the account doesn't have any email attach to it in the server.

1. Report your problem that you forgot your password. They will ask:
+ How did you forgot your password? And yadeyadeya

2. Just be calm and state your problem, make sure it sounds good & legit.
3. There is 93% chance that they will ask If you own the account, say yes and make a world, join the world press F5 then screenshot then give it to him/her.
4. If his/shes convinced, this will work!

### Method 2
Make sure the Minecraft server has a forum/Discord where you can reset your password, talk to the staff, Use optifine version so the account skin will show & there is an email attached on the account in the server.

1. Report your problem that you forgot your password. They will ask:
+ How did you forgot your password? And yadeyadeya
2. Just be calm and state your problem, make sure it sounds good & legit.
3. They might say I will send a code in the account email to make sure you own the account.
4. Just say you forgot the password of the email and your still recovering it and yadeyadeyade, make a world, join the world press F5 then screenshot and give it to him/her.
5. Now she/he can really see that you are login with the skin & name. If shes/his convinced this will work.
